Version: Initial release within ARSL group. Uploaded online with permission from Shengyang Zhuang, Prajwal Agrawal.

Dependencies:
- This code depends on vamtoolbox released by UC Berkeley. Information regarding installing
should refer to https://github.com/computed-axial-lithography/VAMToolbox.
- VAMToolbox is a Python library to support the generation of the light projections and the control of a DLP
projector for tomographic volumetric additive manufacturing. It provides visualization, various optimization
techniques, and flexible projection geometries to assist in the creation of sinograms and reconstructions
for simulated VAM.

Usage instructions:
- Install vamtoolbox and CUDA(optional if choosing Disabled when running).
- Follow the instructions in the README to run the code.
